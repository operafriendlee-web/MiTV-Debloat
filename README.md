## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c54b279-a93a-4732-a06b-bfd6f9cd3b32

Recorded on the TV (2 minutes, no sound): the dock's name and glow following focus, Now Playing, the running-apps screen and its hold-OK menu, Settings with wallpapers previewed as you move, the prayer zone list, and moving an app in the dock.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fefd8d49-178f-4e7a-b011-14a44a562c13

The Globe screen saver (21 seconds, no sound): Settings → Screen saver → **Start now**, then the Earth turning as it is right now, with the Maghrib line passing Malaysia, Makkah and the qibla, the sun's glint on the sea, city lights, the day's earthquakes, map edits as people save them, and the ISS and Tiangong overhead.

## Install

You need an Android TV or Google TV running Android 8.0 or newer, and a computer on the same Wi-Fi. The scripts build the launcher, install it over network ADB and make it the home screen; they work with any TV brand.

- Easiest: the **setup app** ([docs/tui.md](docs/tui.md)). One download for Windows, macOS, Linux or an Android phone (in Termux), nothing else to install. It finds your TV on the Wi-Fi, installs TV Home, cleans up the TV, tweaks animations, HDMI-CEC and surround sound, and can undo everything, explaining each step before it runs. It also shows what the TV is, how it's doing (memory, storage, CPU) and what it can play (video formats, Widevine level, Netflix).
- Step by step: [Windows](docs/install-windows.md) · [macOS](docs/install-macos.md) · [Linux](docs/install-linux.md)
- No build tools? Download the ready-made APK from [Releases](https://github.com/nullifye/RFHN-TV-Launcher/releases/latest) and install it with only adb: [Windows](docs/install-windows.md#install-the-ready-made-apk-instead-no-building) · [macOS](docs/install-macos.md#install-the-ready-made-apk-instead-no-building) · [Linux](docs/install-linux.md#install-the-ready-made-apk-instead-no-building)
- Let an AI coding agent do it: [Install with an AI agent](docs/install-with-ai-agent.md)
- Debloat the TV too, from scratch: give an AI agent [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md)

## Using it

| On the remote | Does |
|---|---|
| Left / Right on the dock | Move between your dock apps |
| Down from the dock | All apps, most used first |
| Up from the dock | Now Playing controls (when something plays), then the top bar |
| Up from the top bar | Running apps: OK force-closes, hold OK for options |
| Hold OK on an app | Move, add or remove dock apps, or open |
| The gear | Settings: wallpaper, prayer zone, azan, cards, screen saver, notifications, phone remote |
| Hold OK on the gear | Quick actions: start screen saver, sleep timer, sleep now, restart, shut down |
| Settings → Net traffic | Start or stop the connection monitor; OK on a connection for its details |
| Settings → Speed test | Download speed and latency from Cloudflare, Netflix or Unifi Malaysia, with the last 10 runs |
| Back / Home | Back to the dock |

**Phone remote:** open `http://<TV IP>:8486` in your phone's browser on the same Wi-Fi and pair with the PIN shown on the TV. Settings → Phone remote shows the exact address. Five tabs:

| Tab | What's on it |
|---|---|
| Remote | Swipe for the D-pad, double-tap for OK, Back, Home, Play/Pause, volume; with USB debugging on, a keyboard for any app and a screenshot of the TV |
| TV | Now Playing, prayer times, system info, the bell's notifications, inputs, power and a sleep timer, and **Send to TV**: a message (a box on the TV until OK) or a link (YouTube and Netflix open in their apps) |
| Apps | Running apps (close or hide), the dock, all apps; hold an app for dock, force close or disable |
| Files | The TV's storage and USB drives: upload, download, open on the TV |
| Settings | The TV's Settings from the phone, including the wallpaper (or upload a photo and set it) and a searchable prayer zone list |

## Benchmark

Against the stock Android TV launcher on the Mi TV (2026-11-04, TV Home 1.16.0). Method and notes: [development.md](docs/development.md#benchmark).

| | TV Home 1.16.0 | Stock Android TV launcher |
|---|---|---|
| Memory, idle / after navigating (PSS) | 87 / **115 MB** | 90 / 178 MB |
| CPU, idle, 60 s | 0.18–0.27 s settled (0.71 s while the weather effects play) | 0.08 s |
| Cold start (process killed → first frame) | **0.76–0.81 s** | 1.47–2.34 s |
| Back to home from an app (wait time) | 18–20 ms | 15–17 ms |
| Janky frames while navigating | **4.8 % (59/1240)** | 29.4 % (109/371) |
| Frame time p50 / p90 / p99 | 9 / **12** / **38** ms | 7 / 28 / 150 ms |
| APK size | **0.53 MB** | 12.7 MB |

## Security

This setup is meant for a TV on your own network, and it deliberately makes the TV quite open. Worth knowing before you run it:

- **USB debugging stays on** (port 5555): anyone on your Wi-Fi can connect with `adb` and control the TV. The launcher uses the same loopback connection for the remote's D-pad and keyboard inside apps, screenshots, sleep/restart and disabling apps. Turn it off in Developer options when you don't need those — the rest of the phone remote keeps working.
- **What the launcher is granted over ADB:** "draw over other apps" (the pairing PIN and messages over any app), an accessibility service (Back and Home from the phone remote, and the remote's Input button), `DUMP` (Now Playing without USB debugging), `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` (choosing and switching the screen saver from TV Home's Settings), `READ_LOGS` below Android 13 (the Live log screen saver and Play Store updates in the bell; it can read the whole system log, which stays on the TV) and All files access (the Files tab and the `Wallpapers` folder). The accessibility service could see what's on screen, but doesn't ask to; it sends Back and Home, and filters one key, the Input button, letting every other key through untouched.
- **Keep accessibility enabled (optional, off by default):** Settings → Misc can restore TV Home's accessibility service if firmware clears it, including while another app is open or after TV Home starts at boot. It uses the existing background service and `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, preserves other accessibility services and backs off during repeated resets. While enabled it also undoes a manual disable in Android Settings: **turn this option off in TV Home first**. Restore tools switch it off before removing access. Emergency opt-out: `adb shell settings put secure tvhome_keep_accessibility_enabled 0`. It cannot work while TV Home is force-stopped or the permission has been revoked.
- **The Weather card fetches public data** while TV Home is open (and keeps it for offline use): MET Malaysia's forecast and warnings for the place set in Settings (data.gov.my), the DOE's APIMS readings, and ECMWF's feels-like temperature and Copernicus air quality for the chosen station's spot (Open-Meteo). Like the Globe, the requests carry nothing about you beyond the TV's address and the `TvHome/1.0` user agent.
- **The Globe screen saver fetches public data while it's on screen** (and keeps it for offline use): NASA's Earth maps (once, from Wikimedia Commons), OpenStreetMap's edits, USGS's earthquakes, CelesTrak's satellite orbits, NOAA's aurora and wind, NASA's snow and ice, the cloud map, and Natural Earth's countries (once) with each country's flag from Flagpedia (the first time it pops up), each only if its layer is switched on. The requests carry nothing about you or the TV beyond what any web request does (its address and a `TvHome/1.0` user agent).
- **Net traffic (optional, off until you start it) is a local VPN.** Android asks before it runs, and a "VPN" badge shows on the home screen while it does. It forwards the TV's traffic on the TV itself (no outside VPN server) and reads only each connection's first outgoing bytes, for the server's name (the TLS hello's SNI or HTTP Host), a plain-HTTP request line or a plain-DNS name. Nothing is decrypted or stored beyond a 30-minute, in-memory list. Countries come from an offline IP list downloaded once, so no address is sent to a lookup service. The first start downloads its small engine (checked against fingerprints in the APK) and the country data (about 30 MB).
- **The phone remote is plain HTTP on port 8486.** Pairing needs a six-digit PIN shown on the TV (five tries, then a lockout that grows to 15 minutes), and the server refuses requests whose `Host` isn't an IP address and any cross-site request, so a web page can't drive the TV. Traffic isn't encrypted though: keep the TV on a trusted WPA2/WPA3 network, never forward the port from your router, and use Settings → Phone remote → Forget all phones if you lose a phone.
- **Releases are signed with the project's own key**, so every GitHub Release updates the last one in place, settings kept. Building it yourself without that key signs with your computer's debug key instead: switching between a self-built and a downloaded APK needs one uninstall, which resets the launcher's settings. See [development.md](docs/development.md#release-signing-and-github-releases).

`scripts/restore.sh` undoes the grants and the home-screen change.

## Undo

```bash
scripts/restore.sh                    # back to the TV's own launcher; re-enables anything this project disabled
scripts/restore.sh --remove-launcher  # ...and uninstalls this launcher
```
